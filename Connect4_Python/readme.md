# Connect 4 game
# Adapted from Keith Galli's Connect 4 https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python
# - Changed scaling the dots based on screen size instead of scaling the screen based on the dots to avoid the screen being too big 
# - Changed the color scheme of the game
# - Changed winning streak check to only check around the most recent dropped piece to increase efficiency
# - Added the ability to change the winning streak length (for example: connect 5 dots to win instead of 4)
